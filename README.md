# Harry and Tim are entering The Arena!

Hardhat Harry and his rival Techy Tim are in the house! This update includes a brand new loading screen, two new characters, and polished gameplay and graphics.

## Hardhat Harry

Harry is a former construction worker that has come to the arena with a vengeance. His stun gun leaves opponents helpless while his trusty shovel can burrow underground and create a damaging wall on the opponents half. His wall deals damage so make sure to keep your distance while it is up. And if you're using Harry as your brawler, make sure to hit your opponents with your shovel after you stun them. Even better if you trap them in a corner, because then you can stun them again!

## Techy Tim

Techy Tim has left his boring career as an engineer (let's be honest, game development is where the fun is anyways) to battle his foes with his innovative - and dangerous - technology. He has brought his two AI powered inventions to the arena to deal massive damage to his enemies. When Tim calls on him, Donny the Drone takes to the skies and drops four artillery bombs across the opponents half. This attack is tough to predict, especially for less mobile brawlers... Harry... we're talkin bout you guy. Tim's first ever invention, Tommy the Turret, may be less mobile, but he can pack even more of a punch than Donny if used properly. Place Tommy outside of cover and he will force your opponents into a life-threatening ultimatum - tank Tommy's bullets or endure Donny's airstrike. You might be thinking, "Tim's inventions seem way too unfair for his opponents". Well don't worry, his opponents are thinking that too.
