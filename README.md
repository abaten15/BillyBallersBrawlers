# New Characters are here!

Billy Baller's friends have come to join the party! Slip Slip Steve and Assaassin Abby have come to the arena and brought some wild weapons with them. This update includes both characters along with a new profile that will be linked to your phone.

## Slip Slip Steve

Steve's slime gun can control an area and push enemies out of cover. He uses his special to force enemies into the open then unloads a swarm of bullets on them. He thrives against opponents that like to use cover but be warned, the speedier the enemy, the harder the battle for Steve.

## Assassin Abby

Abby quit her job as a hired gun to join Billy and his friends in the arena. Her fast move speed and quick attacks make her a great brawler for players looking for a high skill cap. Her throwing star deals massive damage if it connects, but no need to worry on your misses. When her throwing star reaches the opponents side without making contact, it splits into two (allowing slight AOE and the ability to deal damage to enemies behind cover). Her years of "practice" allow her to snipe enemies over walls. If you make contact with the opponent they will be hurting bad for the rest of the match. It's not aan easy shot to hit however, so make it count!

## User Profiles

When opening up Billy's your phone will connect to your unique account (or create an account for new players) and pull all of your information. Everyone starts of with Billy, Steve, and Abby unlocked but as more brawlers get created you will have to earn the chance to fight with them. This profile capability will allow for progression of brawlers, clans, and a tutorial/free play to harness your skills.
